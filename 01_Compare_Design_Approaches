EXAMPLE: Studying for a final exam
Iterative: study a bit of each of 6 chapters on day 1; study more of each on successive days until complete
Inremental: read 50% of chapter 1 on day 1; finish chapter 1 on day 2; continue until complete

EXAMPLE: Credit Card Functionality and Debit Card Functionality
